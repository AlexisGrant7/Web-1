        <p>I love to draw and create art. My favourite mediums to work with are pencil, ink, and watercolour. My love for art eventually led me to become intrested in graphic design. I love designing posters for bands and local gigs, and Iâ€™m also intrested in designing album artwork. I have been playing drums for nine years and I currently play drums in The Orchids. We are a two-piece rock and punk band based out of Truro. We perform regularly in Halifax, Truro, and Moncton. I love to collect records and CDS. I have a collection of roughly 300 records, and nearly 2000 CDS. Some of my favourite bands include Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss, Death From Above 1979, Alexisonfire, Jucifer, and Frankie and the Witch Fingers.</p>
