        <p>I love to draw and create art. My favourite mediums to work with are pencil, ink, and watercolour. My love for art eventually led me to become intrested in <i>graphic design</i>. I love designing posters for bands and local gigs, and Iâ€™m also intrested in designing album artwork. I have been playing drums for nine years and I currently play drums in <b>The Orchids</b>. We are a two-piece rock and punk band based out of Truro. We perform regularly in Halifax, Truro, and Moncton. I love to collect records and CDS. I have a collection of roughly 300 records, and nearly 2000 CDS. Some of my favourite bands include <u>Queens of the Stone Age</u>, Kyuss, Death From Above 1979, Alexisonfire, Jucifer, and Frankie and the Witch Fingers.</p>
